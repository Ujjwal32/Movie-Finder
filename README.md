# Movie-Finder
This is a simple API project based on JavaScript. This uses a free API named OMDbapi which is a online database for movies.
This app helps in finding movies through title and display it's information with poster, plots, awards etc. This includes two JS files which use fetch and XML for fetching apis. THis is just to learn about these two things.
